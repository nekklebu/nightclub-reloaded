# Future Developments

A running wishlist of features, enhancements, and ideas for `thenightclub` — all of them with a 0 to 100% chance of being tackled one day :3.

## Near-Term Goals

- ✅ **Cloud Run Deployment**: Finalize the initial launch to GCP
- ⏳ **Submodule Split**: Extract static content microservice into its own submodule
- ⏳ **GitHub Actions**: Set up full CI/CD pipeline (formatting, testing, deploy)
- ⏳ **Secrets Management**: Migrate from `.env` to GCP Secret Manager
- ⏳ **Custom Domain**: Map to a clean domain + SSL + CDN setup

## Medium-Term Ideas

- **Jukebox click redirect**: Open an external link to the full song on the jukebox daily
- **Admin Interface Styling**: Customize Django admin UI with a personal theme
- **API Layer**: REST or GraphQL endpoints to expose blog/portfolio data
- **JavaScript Enhancements**: Page transitions, light interactivity, no heavy framework yet
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: More robust test coverage across the stack
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Experiment with multi-language support

## Long-Term Aspirations

- **AI-Generated Moodboards**: Integrate with Moodboard API (see sister project)
- **Gamified Portfolio**: Add interactive, game-like elements to the portfolio
- **Site Analytics**: Self-hosted analytics (Plausible or Umami)
- **OAuth/SSO Auth**: Auth experiments for personal dashboard features
