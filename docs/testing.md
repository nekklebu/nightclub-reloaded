# Testing

Testing for `thenightclub` is still in its early stages, but thats okay. It's a personal website. Just some initial pytest framework is set up with smoke tests for now. Writing this doc to try to keep myself a bit more honest.

## Future Milestones

- ðŸ”¹ Add a smoke test suite for cloud-deployed containers
- ðŸ”¹ Add pre-merge CI test runs via GitHub Actions
- ðŸ”¹ Mock static server / external service boundaries
