# Philosophy

`thenightclub` is really less of a portfolio, blog, or website,\,\, it's a declaration of intent.

This project is about _experimentation, growth, and reclaiming my love for software._

After time away from the industry, I wanted something that reminded me why I fell in love with this field in the first place. Code I could care about, systems to tune to my own rhythm, and design that didn't feel like work.

## Values

- **Simple as my soul**:
  - A girl is a big fan of clean code, minimal frameworks, and plain HTML/CSS packed with personality.
- **Craft over trend**:
  - Freedom of tech choice is most at risk in the workplace. I love the spark of interest in learning new tools.
- **The monoliths of old**:
  - I spent the better part of 5 years decoupling fragile services while bringing them up to date with modern build tools and CI/CD practices. So no thanks actually.
- **Project Infrastructure by Discovery**:
  - You shouldn't need the local village seer to help navigate here. A good look or two and you have the lay of the land.
- **Seamless local development**:
  - First and foremost I should be able to build, test, iterate, and debug locally. Ideally with haste.
- **Keeping it fun**:
  - The site is def whimsical in nature, but the stack is sharp. To me, formatting, structure, and CI are all apart of the art.
- **Low-stake Engagement**:
  - No pressure to finish. No sacrificing quality to meet business deadlines. No feature unless its meaningful to _me_.

## Why “The Nightclub”?

Because it’s a weird name for a website, even moreso for _this_ website.<br>
Because late-night coding is ~~scared~~. sacred. I mean sacred.<br>
Because given the choice between a nightclub and at home tinkering, I'd usually rather be here<br>
Because it’s my late night escape. Throw on some music, have some fun,\, ~~maybe a drink or two~~\,\,\,<br>
